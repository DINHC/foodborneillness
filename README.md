# Foodborne Illness in the United States from 1998-2015
 
Team Wolves 

Project Members: Everett Waterman, Dinh Chau, Merari Cisneros
 
Project Description: Using a dataset from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided by Kaggle Team Wolves will investigate data trends in the incidence of foodborne illnesses in the United States from 1998 to 2015. The main goal of this project will be to identify the most common food contaminants. Upon identifying the most common contaminants we would also like to gather information about the linkage between these contaminants and food type, geographical location, and year. Using the data visualization techniques we have learned in the class thus far we will strive to provide insight into the most prominent sources of foodborne illness in the United States which could help with disease prevention and ultimately better health outcomes.

Questions to be answered:
What are the most common food contaminants and resulting illnesses?
How do the incidence rates of these contaminants relate to food type?
How do the incidence rates of these contaminants relate to location?
How have these trends changed between 1998 and 2015?
 
Breakdown of tasks
 
Dinh will be focusing on the relation of illness to food type.
Merari will be focusing on questions relating to the spread of cases by state.
Everett will be focusing on the trends in cases by year.


## State Analysis
* Clean Data
* Group the data set by state
* A bar graph for 5 states with most hospializations
* A bar graph for 5 states with the most Fatalities
* Plot line graphs for each of the 5 states (Hospitalizations Vs.Time)
* Plot line graphs for each of the 5 states (Deaths Vs. Time)
* Scatter plot (Hospitalizations Vs. Fatalities) for the state with the most hospitalizations and fatalities (sum Hosp + Fat)

## Cleaning
* Duplicate records in my data
* irrelevant data (Look at the categories and see if any dont belong)
* Deal with missing data. zeros for numerical , and 'Missing' for categorical
